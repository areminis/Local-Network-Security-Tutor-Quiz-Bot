Abstract
We consider in this paper the information-theoretic secure key distribution problem over
main and wire-tap noise channels with a public discussion in presence of an active adversary. In
contrast to the solution proposed by ourselves for a similar problem using hashing for privacy
amplication, in the current paper we use a technique of extractors.
We propose modied key distribution protocols for which we prove explicit estimates of key
rates without the use of estimates with uncertain coecients in notations O;
;.
This leads in the new conclusion that the use of extractors is superior to the use of hash
functions only with the very large key lengths `(of order`>105bits).
We suggest hybrid key distribution protocols consisting from two consecutively executed
stages. At the st stage it is generated a short authentication key based on hash function,
whereas at the second stage it is generated the nal key with the use of extractors. We show
that in fact the use of extraction procedure is eective only at the second stage. We get also
some constructive estimates of the key rates for such protocols.

Advances in design and implementation of quantum computers [1] as well as design of super-
fast multiprocessor conventional computers threat some conceptually secure cryptosystems. Hence
perfect one-time pad ciphers proposed by Shannon [2] are necessary. But the use of perfect ciphers
requires key lengths proportional to messages [3]. This inconvenience can be solved with the use
of key distribution over communication channels protected from eavesdropping. There are several
approaches in order to remove (or at least to control) an eavesdropping on the keys:
quantum channels [4],
methods based on uctuation of radio wave channels [5, 6, 7, 8],
Wyner's concept of wire-tap channel,
key generation by hashing of random string initially distributed over noisy channels [9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].
In the current paper, we follow the last approach. The most advanced results in this setting,
under the condition of an active adversary have been obtained by Maurer and Wolf. They proposed
several key distribution protocols [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19] and made a performance
comparison of asymptotic and non-asymptotic key rates for a given level of key security.
We considered in [22] some modication of the Maurer and Wolf's MW-protocol consisting in
using an authentication algorithm over noisy channels, called by ourselves the -protocol , instead
of the request-response algorithm presented in [17]. In the same paper [22], we proposed also the
-protocol that diers from the -protocol in absence of the hash function transmission over public
discrete channel because the hash function can be formed from the string which the users have got
just after the execution of the initialization phase. Using the -protocol entails an increasing of
the key rate in several cases. We proposed also in [22] the so called 0and0-protocols in which
special initially distributed short keys are used in order to provide authentication procedures over
public discussion channels (PDC).
Hybrid protocols comprising pairs of sequentially executed protocols ( ;0), (;0), (;0),
(;0) were investigated in [22]. The rst protocol in each pair is used to generate an authentication
2key, whereas the second one provides a generation of the main secret key for encryption/decryption
given the authentication key. The relation among the key rates and a comparison of protocol
performance evaluation were also introduced.
The main feature of the protocols considered in [22] is their strict constructiveness because the
parameters determining their eciency do not contain unknown coecients typical for O;
;-
estimations.
Our contribution and novel content in the current paper are the following:
1. We propose some new (modied) key distribution protocols using extractors. We prove ex-
plicit estimates of key rates without the use of estimates of uncertain coecients in O;
;-
estimations. (In [22] we solved the similar problem using hash functions instead of extractors).
In contrast to [17], we consider a scenario where the legal users are able to receive raw bit
strings over noisy channels and as a consequence they are pairwise distinct. This entails the
need to send check symbols from user A to user B in order to agree the raw bit strings received
by legal users. By the same reason, we have changed the authentication algorithm: instead of
a request-response algorithm [17], we use a non-interactive one based on the authentication
code.
A consideration of the non-asymptotic case leads us in the new conclusion that the use of
extractors is superior to the use of hash functions only for very large key lengths ( `) of the
order of 105bits.
2. We suggest hybrid key distribution protocols consisting of two consecutively executed stages.
At the rst stage, a short authentication key based on a hash function is generated, whereas
at the second stage, the nal key using extractors is generated. We show that in fact the use
of an extraction procedure is eective only at the second stage. We get also explicit estimates
of key rates for such protocols.
3. We prove also an asymptotic behavior of the key rates for all considered protocols that allows
to compare the potential eciency of them with the potential eciency of protocols considered
here and in [22].
3The outline of this paper is the following: Section 2 contains the preliminaries and descriptions
of the main procedures to be used in key distribution protocols. In Section 2.1 we describe the
model of key distribution based on noisy wire-tap channels in the presence of an active adversary
and we introduce the main criteria for key distribution protocol eciency. We introduce main
procedures as error correction, authentication and privacy amplication (based both on hashing
and extraction). In section 3 we describe the ext-protocol, and the new key distribution ext-
protocol without transmission of the extractor's seed on the public discussion channel and we prove
their main features. In section 4 we present a modication of the previous 0
extand0
ext-protocols
under the condition that initially the legal users share short authentication keys. In section 5 we
describe the so called hybrid protocols as combinations of dierent pairs of single protocols and we
estimate their performance evaluation. In section 6 we conclude the paper.
2 Main notions and procedures involved in the key distribution
protocol
Here, we repeat mostly the content of the same point as in [22]. It is done in order to provide an
independent reading of the current paper.
2.1 Model for key distribution and the main criteria for protocol eciency
Let us consider the model of key distribution between a legal user, Alice (A), and another user, Bob
(B), in the presence of an active adversary, Eve(E), assuming that initially the legal users do not
have shared secret keys. The key distribution protocol (KDP) consists of two phases: initialization
and key generation .
In the KDP initialization phase, A, B, and E receive random i.i.d. sequences X=fxigk
i=1,
Y=fyigk
i=1,Z=fzigk
i=12f0;1gk, respectively, such that for each i, Pr (xi6=yi) =pmand
minfPr (xi6=zi);Pr (yi6=zi)g=pw(see Figure 1). One of the methods to provide legal users A,
B with the sequences X,Yis to generate the truly random sequence S=fsigk
i=12f0;1gkby
some trusted party, say source S, and then to transmit it to the legal users A and B over noisy
channels (as in the source model [9], [12]). We will assume that A and B receive the sequences X,Y
4Figure 1: Model of key distribution protocol over noisy legal channels in presence of an active
adversary.
over binary symmetric channels (BSC) without memory with error probabilities A= Pr (xi6=si),
B= Pr (yi6=si), while the adversary E receives the sequence Zover a BSC with error probability
E= Pr (zi6=si). It is easy to see that if the original sequence Sis truly random then the
same property holds for the sequences X,YandZ. (Examples of practical implementation of the
initialization phase in real world can be found in [22]). In this phase it is natural to assume that
the adversary is unable to intervene the transmission from S to A and B.
The key generation phase consists in an information exchange over a public discussion channel
(PDC) with a goal to share eventually the nal key. We note that the use of PDC is necessary
in order to send check symbols to test the agreement of the strings X and Y and sometimes for
the parameters of the hash function or extractor seed transmission (see details in the following
sections). The adversary E can receive all information transmitted over the PDC. We assume also
that the PDC's between legal users and E are binary noiseless channels (if E does not intervene
in transmission). However E can change or replace this information as desired and therefore it is
necessary to authenticate messages transmitted over a PDC in order to detect any intervention of
E and to reject suspicious messages.
Let us dene the following parameters of the key distribution protocol characterization:
`: the key length (the number of bits which are contained in the keys KAandKB),
I(KA;U): the amount of Shannon's information in possession of the adversary E about the
nal keyKAafter receiving all acceptable information U, including the sequence Zand the
5other messages transmitted over the PDC
Pe= Pr (KA6=KB): the probability of legal users keys disagreement,
Pf: the probability of false rejection of the KDP protocol (when A or B falsely believe that E has
intervened the PDC),
Pd: the probability of deception false information provided by E during information transmission
over PDC (it can result in an opportunity to x a key between any legal user and E although
leaving the legal user on the belief that he (she) has shared a key with his (her) legal partner),
Rk: the key distribution rate (the ratio of the key length `to the length of sequences X,Y),
Rk=`
k:
It is reasonable to impose the following conditions on the KDP:
`=`req; (1)
I(KA;U)Iadm; (2)
PePadm
e; (3)
PfPadm
f; (4)
PdPadm
d; (5)
where`reqdenotes the required key length and the superscript adm stands for admissible parameter
value . We will say that the above conditions are requirements of the KDP . The eciency of the
KDP will be estimated by the key rate Rkand then among all protocols satisfying (1)-(5), we will
select the most ecient by making Rkto attain its largest value. As we will show later, some
inequalities (2)-(5) may randomly hold. Then an additional requirement can be stated as
PriskPadm
risk; (6)
wherePadm
riskis the probability that at least one of the inequalities (2)-(5) does not hold.
62.2 Known asymptotic results regarding key rates
Let us denote by R,Rthe maximum achievable key rates in a KDP between the legal users
under the condition of a passive or active adversary, respectively. In the papers [12], [14], [17], [19]
the proofs of these values were presented. For the source model of the wire-tap channel with
initialization phase in the KDP using BSC with probabilities A,B,Ethe following theorem
holds:
Theorem 1 (see [19]) IfE>AandE>B, thenR=R. If eitherEAorEB
thenR= 0.
We note that under the conditions E>AandE>B, the users A and B either share the key
or they may detect interception in the case of E's intervention. This fact cannot be interpreted as
a defect of KDP because E can use even a simple strategy: she tries to break o the PDC between
legal users in order to impede the completion of the KDP. Let pm,pA
w,pB
w, denote the probabilities
of disagreements among the sequence pairs ( X;Y ), (X;Z), (Y;Z) respectively. Then
pm=A+B 2AB
pA
w=A+E 2AE
pB
w=B+E 2BE
It is easy to see that if E> AthenpA
w> pmand similarly if E> BthenpB
w> pm. We will
consider the worst case for legal users as pw= minfpA
w;pB
wg.
After the execution of the initialization phase the source model is reduced to the channel model
where user A sends the sequence Xkto user B who receives it as Yk, whereas E receives XkasZk.
Then the probability of error on the main virtual BSC between A and B is pmand the probability
of the wire-tap virtual channel from A to E is pw. (The PDC remains the same after such reduction
of the source model to the channel model.)
Theorem 2 (see [19]) In the channel model setup with probabilities pm,pwthe maximum key
distribution rate is
R=g(pw) g(pm); (7)
7wherep7!g(p) = plogp (1 p) log(1 p)is the entropy function .
2.3 Error correcting codes
LetCbe a binary linear error-correcting ( k+r;r)-code and let Crbe a string consisting of rcheck
symbols. It has been proved in [23] that if the information symbols are transmitted on the BSC
with the error probability pm, whereas the check symbols on the noiseless channel, then the average
error probability of decoding on the ensemble of all ( k+r;r)-codes meets the following modied
Gallager's bound
Pe2 kE(Rc); (8)
where
E(Rc) = max
2(0;1)

E0() = (1 +) log2

(10)
is Gallager's function for a BSC with the error probability pm
Rc=k
k+r(11)
is the code rate. We note that in the frame of the above model, the code rate Rcsatises the
inequality
02Rc 1
RcC; (12)
whereC= 1 g(pm) is the capacity of the BSC with the probability of error pm.
It follows from (12) that1
2Rc1
1+g(pm). In the asymptotic case Rc!1
1+g(pm), then
r=kg(pm): (13)
We see from (13) that an arbitrary small value of the erroneous decoding probability is achieved
for large block length if the number rof check symbols (but not block length) is proportional to
the number of information symbols kwith coecient g(pm).
82.4 Authentication based on the class of universal hash functions
In order to execute the authentication procedure, we use the universal hash function which are
described below.
For any nite set A, letjAjdenote its cardinality. For any two nite sets A;B, letHbe a set of
hash-maps A!B. For eachx0;x12A, letH(x0;x1) =jfh2Hjh(x0) =h(x1)gjbe the number
of hash functions in Hthat collide in x0andx1. We recall that Hisuniversal 2,U2in short, if for
eachx0;x12A,H(x0;x1)jHj
jBj.
LetPcolbe the so called collision probability , namely the probability that there occurs a pair of
elements in Acolliding under an uniformly chosen map h2H. Clearly,PcoljBj 1. The class H
isstrongly universal 2,SU2, if
8x2A;8b2B:jfh2Hjh(x) =ygj=jHj
jBj(14)
and besides for any distinct x0;x12A, and anyy0;y12B,
jfh2Hjh(x0) =y0&h(x1) =y1gjjHj
jBj:
For a given >0, the class His-almost universal ,-AU2, if for allx0;x12A:H(x0;x1)jHj.
The classHis-almost strongly universal ,-ASU 2, if (14) holds and for any pairs x0;x1andy0;y1
of distinct points in AandB,
jfh2Hjh(x0) =y0&h(x1) =y1gjjHj
jBj2:
Naturally, each class jBj 1-ASU 2is alsoSU2.
Examples of hash functions classes : We assume that the sets AandBconsist of all binary
sequences of lengths aandb, respectively: A=f0;1ga,B=f0;1gb, hencejAj= 2a,jBj= 2b.

classfhsgs2AisU2. Such hash functions are described uniquely by binary strings of length
a.
9AnSU2class. For eachs;t2GF(2a), lethst:A!A,x7!sx+t. The classfhstgs;t2A
isSU2and clearly this class can be indexed by sequences of length 2 a.
An-ASU 2class. It has been shown in [24] that the hash functions chosen from an -
ASU 2class are connected with incomplete balanced schemes . The parameters of the -ASU 2
class can be described as
jAj=q2i;jBj=q ;jHj=qi+2; =i+ 1
q; (15)
whereqis a power of a prime and i>1 is an integer.
Let us analyze the procedure of message authentication. Let xbe the message to be authenticated
during its transmission from user A to user B. User A forms the authenticator y=h(x) of his
messagexusing the keyed hash function h2Hknown by him (but unknown for adversary the
E), then A appends ytoxand sends the pair ( x;y) to the legal user B. In order to check the
authenticity of the message x, the user B receives a pair (~ x;~y) (which may be forged), B forms the
authenticator ~~y=h(~x) with his knowledge of the secret hash function hand compares ~~ywith ~y. If
they coincide then B accepts x, otherwise he rejects it.
It was shown in [24] that if the hash functions, chosen from the -ASU 2class, are used in the
authentication procedure then for the best adversary's strategy consisting in an impersonation or
substitution of the messages, the following probability bounds hold
Pi jBj 1; (16)
Ps; (17)
wherePiis the probability of message impersonation, and Psis the probability of message substi-
tution.
Let us dene the probability of undetected false message deception by the adversary as P=
maxfPi;Psg. The bounds (16), (17) will hold only if the active adversary ignores completely the
used hash function hin the authentication procedure. But there may be situations when the keyed
hash function is partly known by the adversary although authentication procedure is still possible.
10In order to clarify this situation let us recall initially from [14] that for a discrete random variable
taking values over a set Xwith probability distribution Pthe minimal entropy is
H1() = log max
x2XP(x);
and the Renyi entropy of the random variable is
H2() = logX
x2XP2
(x): (18)
Theorem 3 (see [25]) Suppose legal users A and B have the random key hwith length `0within
an authentication scheme based on -ASU 2hash functions where = 2 ~b. Denote by Uthe total
knowledge of E about h. Then, assuming that for any sample u
H1(hjU=u)t`0;0<t< 1; (19)
the probability Pdofmessage undetected deception is upper bounded as
Pd2 ~b `0(1 t)

:
2.5 Authentication based on noisy channels
The message authentication considered above and based on the use of hash functions from either the
classSU2or the class -ASU 2requires a possession by legal users of the secret or partly secret keys.
However such keys cannot be taken directly from the strings Xk,Ykshared in the initialization
phase because they dier even for legal users. On the other hand it is impossible to conciliate
these string by sending from A to B the check symbols strings of Xkbecause PDC is get not
authenticated and B could \conciliate" formerly the false string Zkwith E.
In order to avoid this situation it is necessary rstly to design a keyless message authentication
based on noisy channels. In [12] a special type of codes has been proposed in order to solve this
problem: the so called authentication codes (AC). Let us describe them briey.
In an initialization phase the users share the strings Xk,Ykover a BSC (Pr ( xi6=yi) =pm) and
11they agree an error correcting binary systematic ( na;ka)-codeVin order to authenticate a length
kamessage. The authenticator w= (w1;:::;wna) of a message mis formed as follows: for each
iletvibe thei-th bit of the codeword in Vcorresponding to mandwi=viifvi= 1, or let it
remain undened otherwise.
After receiving a pair ( ~m;~w), the user B forms his authenticator ~~wfor the message ~musing
his stringYkaccording to the agreed procedure and compares ~wwith ~~w. If the number of the
coinciding bits in them is less or equal to some given threshold  wthen the message ~msucceeds
as authentic, otherwise it is removed as forged. The AC's were investigated in [12] and can be
characterized by two probabilities:
Pf.the probability of false removal of the message although adversary E does not intervene at all;
Pd.the probability of the deception of false message, i.e. the probability of the event that E has
forged a message and this fact was not detected by B.
PfandPddo not depend on ordinary minimum code distance of the code Vbut on the so called
minimum asymmetric semidistance d01that is determined by the minimal number of dierences
between 0 and 1 symbols in any pair of distinct code words of V.
Theorem 4 (see [22, 26]) LetVbe an (na;ka)-AC with constant Hamming weight for all non-
zero codewords and with asymmetric semidistance d01. Then the probabilities PfandPdfor the au-
thentication procedure on noisy wire-tap channel with parameters pmandpw, can be upper bounded
as follows:

It is a very hard problem to nd d01for any linear code. But there exists a very simple method to
design the code Vwith known d01, given the linear ( n0;k0)-code ~Vwith known ordinary minimum
code distance dproposed in [12].
12Namely, let us substitute the symbol 1with the symbol pair 10and the symbol 0with 01in
~V.Then evidently the parameters of the code Vare:
na= 2n0; ka=k0; d 01=d ;  =n0: (20)
We have proved in [22] the following theorem with the use of the above code.
Theorem 5 LetVbe a (k0+r0;k0)-error correction code with minimum distance dthat is used
in the authentication procedure. Then for any p;q > 0there exists an integer k0
0and an AC,

It follows from this theorem that
r0
k0+r0!0 ask0!+1:
This means that the length of the authenticator approaches zero as the block length tends to
innity. Other methods to design constant weight AC were investigated in [27].
2.6 Extractors
Let us recall the notion of extractor andstrong extractor [28, 29, 30]. Two probability distributions
P;Q, dened on the same set X, are called -close if their statistical dierence
dif(P;Q) =1
2X
x2XjPX(x) QX(x)j
does not exceed . A mapE:f0;1gkf0;1gu!f0;1g`is an (;)-extractor if for any probability
distribution random variable Xonf0;1gksuch thatH1(X)and any uniformly distributed
random variable   on f0;1gu, the statistical dierence probability distribution of the extractor
outputE(X; ) with respect to an uniform distribution on f0;1g`is at most. In order words, the
extractor maps a random sequence Xof lengthkwith symbols taken from an ensemble of minimal
entropyH1(X) to a random sequence of length `that is-close to an uniformly distributed sequence
with the help of a truly random sequence   of length u. The last sequence can be seen as a \seed"
of the extractor. The extractor E(X; ) has parameters ( k;;u;`; ), wherekis the length of
13input random sequence, is the evaluation of minimal entropy ( H1(X)) on the set of input
sequences,uis the length of the seed  , `is the length of the output sequence, and is the statistical
distance between the output probability distribution and an uniform distribution on the output
set.
A mapping E:f0;1gkf0;1gu!f0;1g`is called a strong extractor E(X; ) if for any proba-
bility distribution random variable Xon the setf0;1gkhaving minimal entropy H1(X)and
for any uniformly distributed random variable   on the set f0;1guthe probability distribution of
the concatenated variables (  E(X; )) is close to an uniform distribution on f0;1g`+u. More

:
This means that the strong extractor provides the closeness of probability distribution for the
concatenation of the output extractor sequence and the seed sequence to an uniform distribution.
In the current paper, we will consider only extractors based on the construction [28, 29] which is
an improvement of the originally proposed by Trevisan [30].
Theorem 6 (see theorem 22 in [29]) For everyk,H1(X),`2Nand >0, such that `

The rst extractor (21), withH1(Xk)
`constant, is used for extraction of an arbitrary part of
randomness ( H1(Xk)) from the input sequence Xk, whereas the second one (22) is needed in order
to extract all randomness `=H1(Xk) from the input sequence Xk.
We are not going to use the estimates based on the O-operator and therefore let us nd a more
accurate estimate for the length of the seed. For this reason we consider in greater detail the design
14Figure 2: Design of the Trevisan's extractor.
of the Trevisan's extractor modied by Raz, Reingold, Vadhan [29].
In order to design the Trevisan's extractor it is necessary to realize three components:
1. The linear error code W: With parameters (~ n;k) and minimal code distance dw, where
~n= 2,2N. It is proposed to take this code as a concatenation of the Reed-Solomon and
the Adamar codes.
2. Combinatorial block design scheme. ( Balance incomplete block design , BIBD). This is a family
of setsS=fS1;S2;:::;S`gholding the following properties:
Sif1;2;:::;ug;
jSij=;
i6=j=) jSi\Sjj<logcwithc1: (23)
This means that the family consists of `sets or blocks, each consisting of elements taken
from the set of integers f1;2;:::;ug, while the number of elements contained simultaneously

The design of the extractor based on the three components given above is presented in Figure 2.
The algorithm is executed in the following stages:

2.7 Privacy amplication
The procedure of privacy amplication (PA) at the nal stage of the key generation between users A
and B has been investigated in detail in [10, 17]. PA can be implemented either by hashing [10, 17]
or by extraction [28]. We will consider in the current paper the second approach.
In order to compare our new results with the results obtained in [22] where hashing has been
used as the privacy amplication procedure, let us specify an application of both methods.
The sequence Xkof lengthkbits is mapped by the user A to the sequence X`
Aof length`
through a keyless hash function from the class U2, orSU2. In a similar manner the user B forms
his keyX`
Bafter error-correcting his sequence Yk.
The most important parameter of the PA procedure is the residual Shannon's information
received by the adversary E, concerning the nal key KA=KB. The estimates of this information
leaking of E are given in [10, 17] for dierent settings of wire-tap channels. The more general bound
is presented below.
17Theorem 10 (see [10]) LetXkbe the sequence of length ktransmitted from A to B over a BSC
with the error probability pmand received by B as the sequence Yk. Assume also that Zkis the result
of receiving Xkby the adversary E over a BSC with probability pw, while the Renyi information
contained in ZkaboutXkist. LetHbe aU2-class of hash functions from f0;1gkintof0;1g`,
known by all participants (A, B and E) and let h2Hbe a truly random hash function chosen
by A, transmitted to B over a PDC. If the users A and B compute their keys as KA=h(Xk),
KB=h(~Yk), then the amount of Shannon's information about the keys KA;KBis upper bounded
as
I(KA;Zk;h)2 (k ` t)
ln 2: (28)
The Renyi information tis connected with the Renyi entropy H2(XkjZk) as
t=k H2(XkjZk): (29)
For the BSC used as wire-tap channel we have by (18)
H2(XkjZk) = klog 
p2
w+ (1 pw)2
:
If the adversary receives some extra information about Xkaside the information contained in Zk
(for instance the sequence Crof check symbols of length reavesdropped by E over the PDC), then
the amount of conditional Renyi entropy H2(XkjZk;h;Cr) that received E can be estimated by the
theorem 11 appearing below. (This theorem also gives the estimation of the amount of conditional
minimal entropy H1(XkjZk;h;Cr) which we use later).
Theorem 11 (see [17]) LetXandCbe two random variables and let s>0. Then the following
inequalities hold:
H2(X) H2(XjC=c)logjCj+s (30)
with a probability at least 1 2 s
2 1,
H1(Xk) H1(XkjC=c)logjCj+s (31)
with a probability at least 1 2 s.
18We can apply (30) in order to estimate H2(XkjZk;h;Cr). Then we get
H2(XkjZk;h;Cr)H2(XkjZk;h) r s: (32)
It follows from (29) and (32) that
~t=k H2(XkjZk;h;Cr)
k H2(XkjZk;h) +r+s
=t+r+s: (33)
Substituting ~tfrom (33) into (28) instead of t, we get the upper bound of Shannon's information
leaking to E
I(KA;Zk;h;Cr)2 (k ` t r s)
ln 2;
that holds with a probability Prisk1 2s
2 1:In order to compare the performance of privacy
amplication based on hashing and on extraction, let us prove a new lemma establishing a con-
nection between the Shannon's information leaking to adversary regarding the key at the output
of the extractor, and the statistical dierence among distribution of the nal key and an uniform
distribution.
Lemma 1 If the statistical distance between the output of the extractor generating the length `key
and an uniform distribution is at most , then the amount of the Shannon's information concerning
the key got by any adversary is upperly bounded as
I(K`;Zkj u)2`p:
Proof. The following inequality holds by denition of strong extractor
dif( uExt(Zk; u);V`+u): (34)
The meaning of this inequality is that the probability distribution of the concatenation of the
extractor's output and the \seed"  uis close enough to an uniform distribution. In order to
19simplify the notation, let us denote by Dthe term at the left of (34). We note initially that for an
uniform distribution on the space V`+u, the following equality holds
D=M u[dif(Ext(Zk;u);V`)]: (35)
whereuis a random sequence and M u[] is the expectation with respect to the distribution on
 u. In fact,Ditself can also be expressed as the term:
1
2X
u;e`2EPEj u(e`)P u(u) PV`(v`)PVu(vu); (36)
wheree`is the output sequence of the extractor E.
Since the distributions P u(u) andPVu(vu) are both uniform, the term (36) gives:
D=1

proving (35). By combining (34) and (35) it is obtained
M u[dif(Ext(Zk;u);V`)]: (37)
Using the well known Markov's inequality, (37) implies
P uh
dif(Ext(Zk;u);V`)i

where1 is some arbitrary value.

20Taking into account that the output extractor sequence is just the key, we can write
H
Ext(Zk;u)

K`j u=u

Then by substituting (39) into (38), we have that the inequality

Then for the amount of information leaking of an adversary concerning the key K`, given the
knowledge of  u, the following bound is obtained
I(K`;Zkj u)`

The right side of (43) is minimized under the condition =1pgiving the nal inequality
I(K`;Zkj u)2`p
providing thus the desired result. 
It follows from the above lemma that if the value of the statistical dierence at the extractor
output that forms the length `key does not exceed , then the amount of the residual information
regarding the key obtained by the adversary does not exceed 2 `p.
21This means that a requirement, regarding the amount of Shannon's information on the key
leaking to an adversary, of the form I(K`;Zkj u)Iadmwill be fullled if 2 `p=Iadm. This fact
results in the following requirement to the extractor's statistical distance:

3 Key distribution protocols
3.1 Statement of the protocols
Two key distribution protocols in presence of an active adversary have been proposed by Maurer
and Wolf in [17]: the UH-protocol , in which privacy amplication procedure was executed using
hash functions and the EX- protocol based on extractions. It has been shown in [17] that the EX-
protocol majors the UH-protocol with respect to several conditions.
We want to investigate a performance of these and other new protocols. We will show that our
new protocols are superior than those considered in [17] for non-asymptotic cases (e.g. when the
sequence lengths are nite).
Initially we consider modied UH- and EX-protocols and denote them as andext, respectively.
A dierence between the original and the modied protocols is determined by two factors.
1. We consider protocols under the condition A6= 0,B6= 0,A;B<E, or equivalently the
conditionspm>0,pw> pm, see Figure 1. This requires to send the check symbols from A
to B in order to conciliate XkandYk.
2. Instead of the authentication algorithm \ request-response " presented in [17], we will use non-
interactive the AC-based algorithm (see Section 2) because this allows the users to provide
authentication even when the sequences XkandYkdo not coincide completely. By the same
reason, the authentication algorithm and the number of substrings of the original strings Xk
andYkare changed.
Before the execution of the ,ext-protocols, the users A and B divide their respective sequences
Xk,Yk, intoXk1
1,Xk2
2andYk1
1,Yk2
2of lengthsk1;k2. (The rst parts Xk1
1andYk1
1will be used
22for key generation in the execution of the PA procedure while the second parts Xk2
2andYk2
2will be
used in the execution of the authentication procedure). Since the -protocol was already considered
in [22], we move on to the ext-protocol [31].
1. The user A forms the string Cr1
1of check symbols of length r1to the string Xk1
1using a
(k1+r1;k1)-error correcting code C1. (This code should be agreed by users in advance.)
2. The user A generates a truly random binary sequence (which will be used as an extractor
seed) of length u.
3. The user A forms the authenticator wfor the message ( Cr1
1;) using for that an AC based
on an error correcting ( n0;k0=r1+u;d)-code and the sequence Xk2
2.
4. The user A sends to B the message ( Cr1
1;) over a PDC appended with the authenticator w.
5. The user B veries the authenticity of the message ( Cr1
1;) through the known ( n0;k0)-AC
and his string Yk2
2(see section 2.5). If authenticity is conrmed, then B goes to the next
step. Otherwise he rejects the KDP.
6. The user B corrects the error in string Yk1
1through the check symbols string Cr1
1. We denote
by~Yk1
1the stringYk1
1after error correction.
7. In order to get the keys KAandKBboth users A and B execute a privacy amplication
procedure based on an extractor (see section 2.6): KA=Eext(X1;),KB=Eext(~Y1;).
Recall that the -protocol diers from the ext-protocol in that it generates a hash function h
in step 2. This hash function jointly with the check symbols of Cr1
1and the authenticator ware
transmitted to B (steps 3-5). In the seventh step, this hash function is needed for key generation:
KA=h(X1),KB=h(~Y1).
It has also been proposed in [22] a new -protocol that diers from the -protocol in the
following: After the execution of the initialization phase, both users A and B have got the strings
that can in fact be used to form the hash functions. In this way, we do not require to send the hash
functions over the PDC, hence the length k2used before for authentication of the hash function
can be shortened. Therefore we may expect that the length of the substring X1is increased (if the
23total length of the string Xis xed). But such conclusion is not so apparent because we have to
extract the hash function as a segment from the string X.
A similar problem appears in the case in which an extractor is used instead of a hash function
for privacy amplication. In the ext-protocol A generates a truly random sequence and sends
it to B jointly with the authenticator of . But the required sequence can be gotten directly by
both users A and B from the initially distributed strings XandY. This results in the following
ext-protocol. It is worth to note that although is not uniformly distributed from the adversary's
point of view this has no relevance for strong extractors.
Within the above setup, the users A and B divide the strings Xk,Ykinto three disjoint parts
Xk1
1,Xk2
2,Xk3
3andYk1
1,Yk2
2,Yk3
3withk1+k2+k3=k. Then they execute the following steps:
1. The user A forms the length r1stringCr1
1of check symbols of the string Xk1
1using the error
correcting ( k1+r1;k1)-codeC1, agreed in advance.
2. The user A forms the length r2check string Cr2
2of the string Xk3
3using the error correcting
(k3+r2;k3)-codeC2, agreed in advance.
3. The user A forms the authenticator wof the message ( Cr1
1;Cr2
2) using an AC and his substring
Xk2
2.
4. The user A sends to B the message ( Cr1
1;Cr2
2) over a PDC appended with w.
5. The user B veries the authenticity of the message ( Cr1
1;Cr2
2) using a AC and his substring
Yk2
2. If it is conrmed then he goes to the next step. Otherwise he rejects the KDP.
6. The user B corrects errors on strings Yk1
1,Yk3
3, using the check strings Cr1
1andCr2
2. Denote
by~Yk1
1,~Yk3
3, the strings Yk1
1,Yk3
3, after error corrections.
7. The users A and B take their substrings Xk3
3,~Yk3
3, wherek3=u, as the second argument u
in their extractors.
8. Both users A and B form the keys as KA=Eext(X1;X3),KB=Eext(~Y1;~Y3).
243.2 Performance evaluation of the protocols
A theorem has been proved in [22] determining the optimal parameters for both the , and-
protocols depending on the posed requirements. Let us prove a generalization of that theorem for
the,,ext, andext-protocols. We will assume that for the , and-protocols a hashing is
used as privacy amplication procedure, whereas for ext, andext-protocols an extraction is used.
Moreover we assume that the rst extraction scheme considered in section 2.6 is used, where the
number of random bits u is determined by equation (27).
Theorem 12 Let us assume that the users A, B and the adversary E have binary strings Xk,Yk
andZk, respectively after execution of the initialization phase over the wire-tape channel, pw=
Pr (xi6=yi),pw= minfPr (xi6=zi);Pr (yi6=zi)g,pm0,pw> pm. Then A and B are able to
form a common key of length `satisfying the requirements (2)-(6) after the execution of any of
the,,ext, andext-protocols if the parts of lengths k1;k2on which were divided the substrings
Xk,Ykfor the, andext-protocols or the parts of lengths k1;k2;k3on which were divided the
substringsXk,Ykfor the, andext-protocols satisfy the equations listed below:

26Proof . For theand-protocols the theorem has been proved in [22]. Let us prove it only for
theext, andext-protocols.
Let the bounds of the KDP parameters meet exactly all requirements (2)-(6), e.g. the following
equation hold:
Pe=Padm
e= 2 k1E(Rc1)
whereRc1=k1
k1+r1is the code rate, and E(Rc1) is computed by (8)-(10). Under the condition that
the adversary gets the sequence Zk1over a BSC with error probability pwthe conditional minimal
entropy is

results:

By substituting (55) into (25), we may write "2

maximized by a proper selection of the parameter c.

Recall that for the AC we had k2= 2n0wheren0is the length of the error correcting ( n0;k0)-
code with minimum distance d. For theext-protocolk0=r1+u, while for the ext-protocol
k0=r1+r2, wherer2is the number of check symbols in the ( k3+r2;k3)-codeC2. This gives
relation (52) for the parameter k0.
Using the Varshamov-Gilbert inequality [32] connecting n0;k0;dand taking into account that
k2= 2n0we get

Solving the equation system (57)-(59), equivalent to the equation system (49)-(51), we nd the
parameters k2;d. The value r2is calculated by (8)-(10), in which it is necessary to let k=ur=r2,
p=pm,Pe=Padm

In line with the above protocols, we have that for the ext-protocol,k3= 0 and for the ext-
protocol,k3=u. This fact proves (53). Then relation (54) is apparent from the protocols descrip-
tion.

k1+k2andRext=`0
k0
1+u+k0
2. For a xed common length, `=`0, we should
provek0
1+u+k0
2k1+k2.
29Figure 4: Dependence of key rate versus the parameter extractor cfor theext-protocol.
Under the requirements (1), (2), (6) posed to the KDP parameters, Prisk,Iadm, it follows
from (47) that `0=`wheneverk1=k0
1andr1=r0
1. Therefore it is necessary just to prove
k2u+k0
2: (60)
According to the scheme of the AC code design we can write k2= 2n0= 2(r1+u+r0), wherer0
is the number of check symbols of the ( n0;k0)-code.k0
2= 2n0
0= 2(r1+r0
2+r0
0), wherer0
2is the
number of check symbols of the ( u+r0
2;r0
2)-codeC2, andr0
0is the number of check symbols of the
(n0
0;k0
0)-code.
By substituting the expressions for k2,k0
2presented above into (60), we get the equivalent
inequalityu 2r0
2+ 2r0 2r0
00. In order to prove this inequality it is sucient to show that
u2r0
2andr0r0
0.
The rst inequality holds because under the theorem's condition, Rc2
3for the (u+r0
2;r0
2)-
code. In order to prove the second inequality, we note that r0is the number of check symbols of the
30information block of length k0=u+r1andr0
0is the number of check symbols of the information
block of length k0
0=r1+r0
2. It is clear that k0k0
0and it is followed from Varshamov-Gilbert
inequality thatd
n0maintains a constant value as the information block length increases in order to
get the required error correction capability. Therefore r0r0
0and this completes the proof of the
theorem. 
With the purpose of comparing the protocols performance with hashing and with extraction,
let us nd the relation of key rate for suciently large `.
Theorem 14 As the key length `!1 , then the following relations hold
R=H2(pw) g(pm)
3 + 2g(pm); (61)
R=H2(pw) g(pm)
2 + 4g(pm); (62)
Rext=Rext=H1(pw) g(pm)
1 + 2g(pm): (63)
Proof. The proofs of (61) and (62) were presented in [22]. In order to prove (63), let us write the
relations of the key rates at the extandext-protocols taking into account (20), (52), (53), (54):
Rext=`
k1+ 2n0
=`
k1+k2
=`
k1+ 2(k0+r0)
=`
k1+ 2u+ 2r1+ 2r0; (64)
Rext=`
k1+u+ 2n0
=`
k1+u+k2
=`
k1+u+ 2(k0+r0)
=`
k1+u+ 2u+ 2r1+ 2r0; (65)
31whereuis the length of the extractor seed, r1is the length of the check string for the ( k1+r1;k1)-
code,r2is the length of the check symbols string for the ( u+r2;u)-code, and r0is the length of
the check string for the AC-code.
According to (13), r=kg(pm) for suciently large `(and hence suciently large k). Let us
rewrite (64), (65) as
Rext=`
k1(1 + 2g(pm)) + 2u+ 2r0; (66)
Rext=`
(k1+u)(1 + 2g(pm)) + 2r0: (67)
According with (47),
k1=`c 2 logPrisk+u+ 3 log`
Iadm
2` 2
+ 3
H1 g(pm): (68)
Substituting k1into (66) produces
Rext=H1 g(pm)
c(1 + 2g(pm)) + 2 (H1 g(pm)) u
`+r0
`: (69)
It is easy to show that
lim
`!1u
`= 0:
Also theorem 5 establishes that lim `!1r0
k0+r0= 0, but since k0!1 as long as`!1 , according
to (47) and (52) we get lim `!1r0
`= 0. Now we can write (69), in the limit Rext=H1(pw) g(pm)
c(1+2g(pm)),
which approaches to a maximum as c!1. This provides a proof of (63) for the ext-protocol.
Similarly, by expressing Rextas (67) using k1as in (68), the used arguments in the proof of (63)
for theext-protocol, show that (63) holds also for the ext-protocol. 
The following trivial corollary results from the above theorem.
Corollary 1 If the channel parameters pmandpware such that
H1(pw) g(pm)
1 + 2g(pm)H2(pw) g(pm)
3 + 2g(pm)(70)
32and
2 (H1(pw) g(pm))H2(pw) g(pm); (71)
thenRextRandRextRrespectively for suciently large `.
Corollary 2 Ifpm= 0, thenRextRandRextR.
Proof. Ifpm= 0, then the relations (70), (71) can be written as
H1(pw)1
3H2(pw) andH1(pw)1
2H2(pw):
Since 2H1(pw)H2(pw) [14], then RextRandRextR. 
Let us exemplify the above results and illustrate that the Rext(`) andRext(`)-protocols major
theR(`) andR(`)-protocols respectively. Let us select the following natural requirements for the
KDP:
Iadm= 10 30; Pd=Pe=Pf=Prisk= 10 5: (72)
In gure 5 we plot the key rates Rkversus its length `for bothRext(`) andRext(`)-protocols
withpm= 0:01 and 0.001, pw= 0:2, and the requirements presented in (72).
The optimization of chas been performed for every value of `. For comparison purposes the
dependences R(`) andR(`) are shown also in the gure.
The following conclusions are drawn immediately after an examination of the obtained depen-
dence.
The protocols using extractors have greater key rate than the and-protocols under suciently
large`and smallpm. It is worth to note that if for the and-protocols the asymptotically possible
value key rate calculated by (61), (62) can be achieved even in the considered key length range, it
is not true for the extandext-protocols, demonstrating a noticeable increasing proliferation of
the key rate outside this range.
We can see that the ext-protocol is superior than the -protocol when ` >5105withpm=
0:01 and the ext-protocol is superior than the -protocol when ` > 3:5106andpm= 0:001
(under the stated requirements in our investigations). The key length for which the extandext-
protocols are superior than the and-protocols essentially depends on the error probabilities in
33Figure 5: The key rates versus their lengths for dierent requirements imposed to KDPs.
the communication channels.
Theext-protocol is superior than the ext-protocol, although these protocols have the same
asymptotic key rate. Hence, protocols with extractors are superior than the protocols with hashing,
whenpm= 0.
4 Key distribution protocols under the condition that legal users
shared short authentication key before starting the KDP
The0and0-protocols have been introduced in [22], which dier from the and-protocols in
that legal users A and B have got a short key SA=SBof length`0before starting the KDP. This
key can be used for authentication of messages transmitted over public discussion channels in order
to get nally the key of length `>>` 0.
In this section we consider some modication of the 0and0-protocols in which instead of hash
34functions, extractors are used in order to generate the nal key. We call these protocols the 0
ext
and0
ext-protocols , respectively.
0
ext-protocol Let us suppose that the users A and B have binary strings Xk,Ykrespectively.
1. The user A calculates the check string Crof lengthrfor the string Xkusing an error correcting
(k+r;k)-codeCthat should be agreed between the legal users in advance.
2. The user A generates a random binary string uof lengthu.
3. The user A computes the authenticator wfor the message ( Cr;u) using a keyed hash function
from the-ASU 2class, and the key SA.
4. The user A sends to user B over a PDC the message ( Cr;u) appending to it the authenticator
w.
5. The user B veries the authenticity of ( Cr;u) using the algorithm presented in section 2. If
the authenticity of ( Cr;u) is conrmed, then B goes to the next step, otherwise he rejects
it.
6. The user B corrects errors in the string Ykusing the check string Cr. (We denote by ~Ykthe
stringYkafter error correction).
7. Both users A and B compute their keys as KA=Eext(Xk;u),KB=Eext(~Yk;u).
0
ext-protocol In a similar manner there is a modied -protocol where the random string uis
not transmitted over the PDC but it is formed from the random sequences Xk,Yk.
The users A and B divide each of the strings Xk,Ykobtained after execution of the initialization
phase into two disjoint substrings Xk1
1,Xk2
2;Yk1
1,Yk2
2, respectively. Then they perform the following
steps:
1. The user A calculates the check string Cr1
1of lengthr1for the substring Xk1
1using an error
correcting ( k1+r1;k1)-codeC1.
2. The user A calculates the check string Cr2
2of lengthr2for the substring Xk2
2using an error
correcting ( k2+r2;k2)-codeC2.
353. The user A forms the authenticator wfor the message ( Cr1
1;Cr2
2), using a keyed hash function
from the class -ASU 2and the key SAwith length `0.
4. The user A sends to B the message ( Cr1
1;Cr2
2) appended with the authenticator w.
5. The user B veries the authenticity of the message ( Cr1
1;Cr2
2) using the authentication algo-
rithm (see section 2) and the key SB. If authenticity is conrmed, then user B goes to the
next step, otherwise he rejects the KDP.
6. The user B corrects errors in the strings Yk1
1,Yk2
2using the check strings Cr1
1andCr2
2. (We
denote by ~Yk1
1,~Yk2
2the strings Yk1
1,Yk2
2after error correction.)
7. The user A takes the string Xk2
2as seeduand the user B takes the string ~Yk2
2as seedu.
8. Both users A and B compute their keys as KA=Eext(Xk1
1;Xk2
2),KB=Eext(~Yk1
1;~Yk2
2).
Let us estimate the key rate of these protocols.
Theorem 15 Let us suppose that the users A, B and the adversary E have binary strings Xk,Yk
andZk, respectively after execution of the initialization phase over the wire-tape channel, pm=
Pr (xi6=yi),pw= min(Pr (xi6=zi);Pr (yi6=zi),pm0,pw> pm. We assume that the users A
and B share initially a short key Sof length`0in order to authenticate messages transmitted over
the PDC.
Then A and B are able to form a common key of length `satisfying the requirements (2)-(6)
after the execution of the 0
extand0
ext-protocols if the lengths k1,k2of substrings Xk,YkandZk

R0
ext= max

k1; R0
ext= max

k1+k2: (80)
Proof. The relations (73), (74) and (76) can be proved similarly as (45), (46) and (47) in
theorem 10. The relation (75) is apparent from the protocols description. In order to prove (77), (78)
we assume that for authentication of messages of length a(see relation (79)) an -ASU 2-hash-
function is used. Relying on (15) we write 2a=q2i, 2`0=qi+2,=i+1
q. Let us put q= 2b,
then
a= 2ib ; ` 0=b(i+ 2); =i+ 1
2b: (81)
Let us assume that the probability of false message deception is equal to =Padm
d. Then from (81),
the relations (77), (78) are valid. The relation (80) follows from the protocols denition taking into
account that the number of the extractor random bits can be optimized with respect to c. 
By substituting (74) into (80) and using (13) we get that as `!1 :

Let us compare the key rates of the 0

the following relations have been proved:
R0!H2(pw) g(pm)
R0!1

Comparing these relations with (84) we may conclude that R0R0

5 Two-stage (hybrid) protocols with extractors
We remember that the hybrid protocols [22, 25] are combinations of protocol pairs ( ;0), (;0),
(;0), (;0) where the rst protocol in each pair is used in order to generate a relatively short
keySof length`0required for hash function and check bits authentication, whereas the second
protocol is used in order to form the nal key K.
The keysSandKcan be obtained by execution of the privacy amplication procedure based
either on the use of hash functions or extractors. This means that for every above mentioned hybrid
protocol pair, there are four variants of hashing or extracting applications. In total, there can be
formed 16 protocols, which in turn can be split into four groups as shown in table 1.
The rst group of protocols was investigated in [22], and there it has been proved that every
such protocol can be the most ecient depending on the additional key requirements imposed to
it. It is worth to note that even for large length `of the keyK, the length `0of the authentication
key occurs moderate [22] (p. 2543). If `= 32000 (pm= 0:01,pw= 0:2,Padm= 510 6), then
`0= 678. But since, as shown in section 3, extractors are superior than hash functions only with
large key lengths, their application is useless in the rst stage of the hybrid protocols, where a short
key is required.
Therefore, the protocols from groups 3 and 4 have not been considered. It is sucient to
investigate protocols from the second group, where the authentication key is generated by hashing
and the generation of the nal keys is performed by extraction. Thus we consider the following
39Figure 7: Dierent types of hybrid protocol with extractors.
hybrid protocols: ( ;0
ext), (;0
ext), (;0
ext), (;0
ext). For a more detailed description with the
design of these protocols and the specication requirements of each protocol component, we refer
to [22] (p. 2544).
Let us give a short description of the ( ;0
ext)-protocol. It is based on the ( ;0)-protocol
proposed by Korzhik and Morales [25]. In this protocol, the sequences Xk,Ykof users A and B
are divided into three parts Xk1
1,Xk2
2,Xk3
3andYk1
1,Yk2
2,Yk3
3respectively (see gure 7-a). The
subsequences Xk1
1,Xk2
2, (Yk1
1,Yk2
2) are used for the generation of the authentication keys SA(SB).
The subsequence Xk3
3(Yk3
3) and the key SA(SB) are used in the 0
ext-protocol for nal KA(KB)
key generation. The key rate of this protocol can be written as
R(;0
ext)=`
k1+k2+k3=`
k3+`0
R; (85)
whereR=`
k1+k2is the keySrate at the length `0in the-protocol.
Let us prove the following lemma.
Lemma 2 The convergence`0
`!0, as`!1 , holds in the (;0
ext)-protocol.
Proof. Let us consider the ( ;0
ext)-protocol. According to (79) the input block length of the
40-ASU 2hash function used in the ext-protocol is equal to a=r3+u. We show initially that
r3+u!1 as`!1 . The relations (76) and (11) give
u
logk3
Iadm

lnc; (86)
r3= (1 Rc)k3: (87)
Thus in order to prove that r3+u!1 it is necessary to show that k3!1 as`!1 . Taking
into account equation (13), we can present (74) in the form
k3=`c logPadm
risk+u+ 3 log`
Iadm
2` 2
+ 3
H1(pw) g(pm): (88)
From the above relation, it follows that k3!1 as`!1 and both (86), (87) result as r3!1
andu!1 . Then using (77) for an estimation of the hash function parameters, we may write
lim
i!1`0
a= lim
i!1i+ 2
2i= 0:

Using (88), the relation (85) can be expressed as
R(;0
ext)=H1(pw) g(pm)
Den 3; (89)
where
Den 3=c

2` 2

+`0
`H1(pw) g(pm)
R:
Taking into account that Ris constant and`0
`!0 (see Lemma 2) we can see that the last
term in the denominator Den 3of (89) approaches to zero as `!1 . The other terms in the
denominator Den 3also approach to zero because they consist either of values approaching zero or
41have a logarithmic dependence on `.
Since the right side of (89) approaches a maximum, R(;0
ext)approaches a maximum as c!1,
then the following asymptotic estimation holds for the key rate of the ( ;0
ext)-protocol
R(;0
ext)=H1(pw) g(pm); (90)
R
(;0
ext)=H1(pw) aspm!0: (91)
In the (;0
ext)-protocol (see gure 7-b) the sequences Xk,Ykare divided into four parts Xk1
1,
Xk2
2,Xk3
3,Xk4
4andYk1
1,Yk2
2,Yk3
3,Yk4
4, respectively. The subsequences Xk1
1,Xk2
2,Xk3
3andYk1
1,
Yk2
2,Yk3
3are used in the -protocol in order to generate the authentication key Sof length`0.
The subsequence Xk4
4(Yk4
4) is used in the 0
ext-protocol for nal keys KA,KBgeneration. One can
write
R(;0
ext)=`
k4+`0
R;
whereR=`0
k1+k2+k3is the authentication key rate.
By comparing this protocol with the previous one, we can conclude that for the same length `
of the nal key, the equality k4=k3should hold. As it was shown in [22], RRand the length
`0of authentication key for the -protocol is larger than the length `0of the authentication key
for the-protocol. Hence
`0(-protocol)
R`0(-protocol)
R
andR(;0
ext)R(;0
ext).
It is easy to show that
R(;0
ext)=H1(pw) g(pm) as`!1; (92)
that coincides with the key rate of the ( ;0
ext)-protocol, see (91). If pm= 0 we get by (92)
R
(;0
ext)=H1(pm):
Next let us consider the ( ;0
ext)-protocol (see gure 7-c) in which each sequence Xk,Ykis
42divided into four parts Xk1
1,Xk2
2,Xk3
3,Xk4
4andYk1
1,Yk2
2,Yk3
3,Yk4
4, respectively. The subsequences
Xk1
1,Xk2
2andYk1
1,Yk2
2are used in the -protocol for the generation of the key SA, orSBfor the
0
ext-protocol, while subsequences Xk3
3,Xk4
4andYk3
3,Yk4
4are used in the 0
ext-protocol for the nal
keyKA(KB) generation assuming Xk4
4andYk4
4as random \seeds" k4while using in extractor.
Similarly to (85) we can write
R(;0
ext)=`
k3+u+`0
R:
The parameter `0is smaller in this protocol than in the ( ;0
ext)-protocol, because only to au-
thenticate the check sequences Xk3
3andXk4
4of total length r1+r2there is used an -ASU 2hash-
function. However the additional item ( u) calculated by (76) increases the denominator and hence
R(;0
ext)R(;0
ext).
In the (;0
ext)-protocol, each sequence Xk,Ykis divided into ve parts Xk1
1,Xk2
2,Xk3
3,Xk4

Xk5

1,Xk2
2,Xk3
3
andYk1
1,Yk2
2,Yk3
3are used in the -protocol to generate the keys SA,SB. The subsequences Xk4
4,
Xk5
5andYk4
4Yk5
5are used in the 0
ext-protocol to generate the keys KA,KB. Let us write
R(;0
ext)=`
k4+u+`0
R:
In this relation by the same reason mentioned during the analysis of the ( ;0
ext)-protocol, the
value`0will be smaller than in the ( ;0
ext)-protocol and the rate Ris larger. Therefore the third
item is slightly decreasing. However the presence of suciently large item u results in a key rate
decreasing giving the inequality R(;0
ext)R(;0
ext).
There may be for the ( ;0
ext), (;0
ext)-protocols some equivalent statement to Lemma 2, e.g.
it can be proved that`0
`!0 as`!1 . Furthermore, by writing the relations for k3,k4andu,
from theorem 12 it is very simple to get asymptotically achievable the key rate for the ( ;0
ext),
(;0
ext)-protocols.
R(;ext)=R(;0
ext)=H1(pw) g(pm): (93)
Comparing (90), (92) and (93) we can see that asymptotically all hybrid protocols have the same

key rates, however the ( ;0
ext)-protocol has non-asymptotically the largest key rate among all
above considered hybrid protocols.
It is worth to compare this protocol with the ( ;0)-protocol, that (as shown in [22]) has
maximum possible key rate for suciently large `among all hybrid protocols using hash functions
in the privacy amplication procedure.
For the (;0)-protocol one can write [22]
R(;0)=H2(pm) g(pm) (94)
By comparing (92) with (94) and taking into account that H2(pm)H1(pm) we can see that for
large`,R(;0
ext)R(;0
ext).
From this inequality, it follows that an implementation of extractors for large key length in
hybrid protocols are inecient.
In gure 8 there are plotted the key rates versus its length for hybrid protocols under the
conditionspm= 0:01,pw= 0:2,Iadm= 10 30,Padm
e=Padm
d=Padm
f= 10 5.
The curves R(`) were plotted with the use of the technique proposed in [22]. They clearly
demonstrate a behavior of the key rate depending on the key length for dierent protocols. We can
see that the ( ;0) and (;0)-protocols have the greatest key rates among all hybrid protocols. The
(;0), (;0), (;0
ext), and (;0
ext)-protocols have approximately equal key rates for large key
44length and the ( ;0
ext) and (;0
ext)-protocols have the least key rate among the above considered
hybrid protocols.
6 Conclusions
In the current paper, an investigation of key distribution protocols based on noisy channels started
in [22] has been continued with such a dierence that extractors are used instead of hash-functions in
the privacy amplication procedure. The main goal was to prove extractor-based protocols eciency
by the criterion of key rate maximization. The relations are non-asymptotic and constructive
because they do not include some uncertain coecients in notations, in contrast with other papers.
We use the modied Trevisan's extractor [30, 29] in our paper. It has been proposed new ext
and
ext-protocols which dier from those known before [17] because the extractor's seed is not
transmitted over the PDC but, instead, it is generated from random sequences obtained by legal
user after the execution of the initialization phase. We proved that the use of extractors in the
extandext-protocols increases the rate, in comparison with hashing-based protocols only for very
large key length `(typically`2[105;106]) and for some specied values of the error probabilities
both in the main and in the wire-tap channels.
It was investigated a performance evaluation of the so called extractor-based hybrid protocols,
consisting of two protocols executed in a serial manner where the rst protocol in a pair is used for
the generation of a relatively short key Sof length`0. This key is necessary for authentication of
check bits, and a random number (seed) of extractor. The second protocol is used for the nal key
generation. We prove that extractor based protocols should be used only in the second protocol of
the pair.
We selected four hybrid protocols for further investigation ( ;0
ext), (;0
ext), (;0
ext) and
(;0
ext)-protocols. The relations for their key rates have been derived for both nite and asymp-
totically growing key lengths. The greatest key rate is got for the ( ;0
ext)-protocol. This protocol
was compared with the ( ;0)-protocol considered in [22], which has the greatest key rate among
all hybrid hashing-based protocols. The investigations showed that hybrid protocols with the use
of extractor-based second stage protocols are less ecient than hashing-based protocol.
45We investigated also (but not in a deeper detail) other variants of extractors from [29]. Even with
some improvement of their characteristics (in the sense of the seed length), the general conclusion
is kept the same: the use of extractors is justied only with very large key length.
We get also asymptotic estimates for the key rates of all proposed protocols that allows to
compare the potential eciency of all considered early protocols. These relations are presented
in table 2. We can see that asymptotically all hybrid protocols have the same key rates equal to
H1(pw) g(pm), that is larger than the key rates for single extandext-protocols that is equal
toH1(pw) g(pm)
1+2g(pm).
These relations are similar \on structure" to relations for key capacity g(pw) g(pm), [19], but
dier from the last one in changing of Shannon's entropy g(pw) to min entropy H1(pw).
If the main channel is noiseless then all protocols using extractors have the same asymptotic key
rates equal to H1(pw). It is worth to note that asymptotically all hybrid extractor-based protocols
are inferior to hash-based protocols. But this conclusion may be considered as a consequence of
crude estimate of information leaking to eavesdropper based on the use of min entropy.
We summarize the key rates for dierent KDP in table 2. It can be seen from this table how
closer or farther are the key rates to the secret key capacity given by (7).
