I. INTRODUCTION  
Quantum key distribution (QKD) [1] [2] provides a way for two parties to expand a secur e key that 
they initially share. The best known QKD is the BB84 protocol published by Bennett and Brassard in 1984 [1]. 
The security of BB84 was not proved until many years after its introduction. Among the proofs [3] [4] [5] [6], 
the one by Shor and Presk ill [6] is relevant to this paper. Their simple proof essentially converts an 
entanglement distillation protocol (EDP) based QKD proposed by Lo and Chau [5] to the BB84 Protocol. The 
EDP -based QKD has already been shown to be secure by [5] and the conversi on successively leads to the 
security of BB84 protocol.  
Security proofs of QKD protocols were further extended to explicitly accommodate the imperfection in 
practical devices [7] [8]. One important imperfection is that the laser sources used in practice an d coherent 
sources that occasionally emit more than one photon in each signal. Thus they are not single –photon sources 
that the other security proofs [3] [4] [6] of BB84 assumed. In particular, BB84 may become insecure when 
coherent sources with strong in tensity are used. For instance Eve can launch a photon -number -splitting (PNS) 
attack puts severe limits on the distance and the key generation rate of unconditionally secure QKD.  
A novel solution to the problem of imperfect devices in BB84 protocol was pro posed by Hwang [9]. Which uses 
extra test states called the decoy states to learn the properties of the channel and/or eavesdropping on the key -
generating signal states. An unconditional security proof of decoy -state QKD [10] [11] is presented.  
Another met hod to combat PNS attack was by Scarani et.al. [12], who introduced a new protocol called 
SARG04, which is very similar to the BB84 protocol. The quantum state transmission phase and the 
measurement phase of SARG04 are the same as that of BB84, as both use  the same four quantum state and the 
same experimental measurement. The only difference between the two protocols is the classical post -processing 
phase, the protocol becomes secure even when Alice emits two photon, a situation under which BB84 is 
insecure  .This protocol was proved by [13] who also proved the security of SARG04 with a single -photon 
source. They also proposed a modified SARG04 protocol that uses same six states as the original six state 
protocols [14] [15]. The security of SAG04 with a singl e-photon source was also proved by Branciard et.al [16]. 
They considered SARG04 protocol implemented with single -sources and with realistic sources. For the single -
photon source case, they provided upper and lower bounds of the bit error rate with one -way classical 
communications. For the realistic source case they considered only incoherent attack by Eve and showed that 
SARG04 can achieve higher secret key rate and greater source distance than BB84.  
Another protocol that is similar to SARG04 is the B92 Pro tocol [17] which uses two nonorthogonal quantum 
states. The security of B92 with a single -photon source was proved by Tamaki et al [18] [19]. On the other hand 
Koashi [20] proposed an implementation of B92 with strong phase -reference coherent light that wa s proved 
secure.  
The Focus of this paper is to survey the most prominent quantum key distribution protocols and their 
security. In this paper we briefly describe the necessary principles of quantum mechanics from which the 
protocols are divided in to two c ategories those based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles and others are 
based on quantum entanglement

II. QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY  
Quantum cryptography is a relatively recent arrival in the information security worl d. It harnesses the 
laws of quantum Mechanics to create new cryptographic primitives. There is however, one quantum 
cryptographic primitive which is achievable with today‟s technology i.e. Quantum key distribution. By using the 
quantum properties of light,  current lasers, fibre -optics and free space transmission technology can be used for 
QKD, so that many observers claim security can be based on the law of quantum physics only.  
Quantum key distribution is a key establishment protocol which creates symmetri c key material by 
using quantum properties of light to transfer information from Client A to Client B in a manner which, through 
the incontrovertible results of quantum mechanics, will highlight any eavesdropping by an adversary.  
 
2.1 The  Heisenberg Uncert ainty Principle  
According the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle, it is not possible to measure the quantum state of any 
system without disturbing that system. Thus the polarization of photon or light particle can only be known at the 
point when it is measur ed. This principle play a critical role in thwarting the attempts of eavesdroppers in a 
cryptosystem based on quantum cryptography.  
For any two observable properties linked together like mass and momentum  
 
  
  
Where     
 A = A -
         and   
 B = B -
  
And where   
  = AB – BA 
 According to the principle two interrelated properties cannot be measured individually without affecting the 
others. The principle is that since you can not partition the photon in to two halves measuring the state of photon 
will affect it value. So if someone tries to detect the state of photons being send to the receiver the error can be 
detected [21]  
 
2.2 Quantum Entanglement  
The other important princip le on which QKD can be based is the principle of quantum entanglement. It 
is possible for two particles to become entangled such that when a particular property is measured in one 
particle, the opposite state will be observed on the entangled particle inst antaneously. This is true regardless of 
the distance between the entangled particles. It is impossible, however to predict prior to measurement what 
state will be observed thus it is not possible  to communicate via entangled particles without discussing t he 
observation over classical channel. The process of communicating using entangled states, aided by a classical 
information channel is known as quantum teleportation and is the basis of Eckert‟s protocol [22].  
 
III.         Qkd Protocols Using Heisenberg’ s Uncertainity Prinicples  
 Quantum cryptography exploits the quantum mechanical property that a qubit cannot be copied or 
amplified without disturbing its original state i.e. No -Cloning Theorem [23] [24]. Key distribution using 
quantum cryptography would b e almost impossible to steal because Quantum key distribution (QKD) [25] [26] 
[27] systems continually and randomly generate new private keys that both parties shares automatically. A 
compromised key in a QKD system is able to decrypt only a small amount o f encoded information because of 
continuously changes in private key. A secret key can be build from a stream of a single photon where each 
photon is encoded with a bit value of 0 or 1, typically by a photon superposition state such as polarization. 
These photons are emitted by a conventional laser as pulses of dim light so that most pulses do not emit a 
photon. This approach ensures that few pulses contain more than one photon travel through the fiber -optic line. 
In the end only a small fraction of the rec eived pulses actually contains a photon [28]. The photons that are 
reached to the receiver are used. The key is generally encoded in either the polarization or the relative phase of 
the photon.  
 
3.1 BB84  protocol  
Quantum cryptography is based upon convent ional cryptographic methods and extends these through 
the use of quantum effects. Quantum key Distribution (QKD) is used in quantum cryptography for generating a 
secret key shared between two parties using a quantum channel and an authenticated classical c hannel as show 
in figure 6. The private key obtained then used to encrypt message that are sent over an insecure channel (such 
as a conventional internet connection).  Quantum Key Distribution Protocols: A Review

Figure 1: Quantum cryptographic communication System for securely transferring Random k ey 
 
The BB84 protocol described using Photon polarization state to transmit the information. It was originally 
developed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984 [1].  
 
 Figure 2: BB84 Bit Encoding  
 
Below are the steps of the BB84 protocol for  excha nge the secret key in the BB84 protocol [29], client A and 
client B must do as follow:  
STAGE 1 PROTOCOL Communication over quantum channel  
 Client A prepare photon randomly with either rectilinear (+) or diagonal polarization (×) therefore Client 
A transmit  photons in the four polarization states  (0, 45, 90,135 degree).  
 Client A records the polarization of each photon and sends it to Client B.  
 Client B receives a photon and randomly records its polarization according to the rectilinear or diagonal 
basis. The  Client B records the measurement type (basis used) and the resulting polarization measured. 
Client B doesn‟t know which of the measurement are deterministic, i.e. measured in the same basis as the 
one used by client A. Half the time Client B will be lucky  and chose the same quantum alphabet as the 
third person.  In this case, the bit resulting from his measurement will agree with the bit sent by Client A. 
However the other half time he will be unlucky and choose the alphabet not used by client A. In this c ase, 
the bit resulting from his measurement will agree with the bit sent by client A only 50% of the time. After 
all these measurement, client B now has in hand a binary sequence  
Client A and Client B now proceed to communicate over the public two -way chan nel using the following stage 
2 protocol.  
STAGE 2 PROTOCOL:  Communication over a public channel  
Phase 1.  Raw Key extraction  
 Over the public channel, client B communicates to client A which quantum alphabet he used for each of his 
measurements.  
 In response  client A communicate to client B over the public channel which of his measurement were made 
correct alphabet.  Quantum Key Distribution Protocols: A Review  
www.iosrjournals.org                                                     4 | Page  Client A and Client B then delete all bits for which they used incompatible quantum alphabet to produce their 
resulting raw keys. If the third pe rson has not eavesdropped, then their resulting keys will be the same. If the 
third person has eavesdropped their resulting key will not be in total agreement.  
Phase 2 . Error estimation  
Over the public channel, Client A and client B compare small portion of their raw keys to estimate the error -rate 
R, and then delete the disclosed bits from their raw keys to produce their tentative final keys. If through their 
public disclosures Client A and Client B find no errors (i.e., R=0), then they know that the thir d person was not 
eavesdropping and that their tentative keys must be the same final key. If they discover at least one error during 
their public disclosures (i.e., R>0), then they know that the third person has been eavesdropping. In this case, 
they discar d their tentative final keys and start all over again.  
 
3.2 BB92  protocol  
Soon after BB84 protocol was published, Charles Bennett realized  that it was not necessary to use two 
orthogonal basis for encoding and decoding. It turns out that a single non -orthogonal basis can be used instead, 
without affecting the security of the protocol against eavesdropping. This idea is used in the BB92 protocol [30], 
which is otherwise identical to BB84 protocol.  
The key difference in BB92 is that only two states are neces sary rather than the possible 4 polarization states in 
BB84 protocol.  
 
Figure 3: BB92 2 -State Encoding  
As shown in figure 3, 0 can be encoded as 0 degrees in the rectilinear basis and 1 can be encoded by 45 degrees 
in the diagonal basis. Like the BB84 pr otocol, Client A transmit to Client B a string of photons encoded with 
randomly chosen bits but this time the bits  Client A chooses dictates which bases Client B must use. Client B 
still randomly chooses a basis by which to measure but if he chooses the w rong basis, he will not measure 
anything; a condition in quantum mechanics which is known as an erasure. Client B can simply tell Client A 
after each bit Client B sends whether or not he measured it correctly [31].  
 
3.3 SARG04 protocol  
The SARG04 protocol  is built when researcher noticed that by using the four states of BB84 with 
different information encoding they could develop a new protocol which would more robust when attenuated 
laser pulses are used instead of single - photon sources. SARG04 protocol w as proposed in 2004 by Scarani et.al 
[32].  
The SARG04 protocol shares the exact same first phase as BB84. In the second Phase when Client A 
and Client B determine for which bits their bases matched, Client A does not directly announce her bases rather 
than Client A announces a pair of non -orthogonal states one of which she used to encode her bit. If Client B 
used the correct basis, he will measure the correct state. If he chose incorrectly he will not measure either Client 
A states and will not be able to d etermine the bit. If there are no errors, then the length of the key remaining 
after the sifting stage is ¼ of the raw key.  
The SARG04 protocol provides almost identical security to BB84 in perfect single -photon implementations: If 
the quantum channel is o f a given visibility (i.e. with losses) then the QBER of SARG04 is twice that of BB84 
protocol, and is more sensitive to losses.  
However SARG04 protocol provides more security than BB84 in the presence of PNS attack, in both the secret 
key rate and distan ce the signal can be carried (limiting distance).  
 
3.4 Six -State protocol (SSP)  
The 6 -state or 3 bases cryptographic is nothing but the well -known BB84 4 -state scheme with an 
additional basis [33]. Six -State Protocol (SSP) is proposed by Pasquinucci and Gi sin in 1999 [34].  
When represented on the Poincare sphere the BB84 protocol makes use of four spin -1/2 states corresponding to 
±x and ±y direction. In brief summary Client A sends of the four states to Client B, who measures the qubits he 
receives in eithe r the X or Y basis. A priori this gives a probability ½ that Client A and Client B use the same Quantum Key Distribution Protocols: A Review  
www.iosrjournals.org                                                     5 | Page  basis. On an average Client A and Client B have to discard half of the qubits even before they can start 
extracting their cryptographic key.  
In the 6 state prot ocols the two extra states correspond to ±z, i.e. the 6 states are ±x, ±y, and ±z on the 
Poincare sphere. In this case Client A sends a state chosen freely among the 6 and Client B measures either in 
the x, y or z -basis. Here the prior probability that Cli ent A and Client B use the same basis is reduced to 1/3, 
which means that they have to discard 2/3 of the transmitted qubits before they can extract a cryptographic key. 
However, this scheme does hold an advantage compared to the BB84 protocol – higher sym metry. As it will be 
seen this fact together with the use of symmetric eavesdropping strategies dramatically reduced the number of 
free variables in the problem under investigation.

IV.        Qkd Protocols Using Quantum Entan glement  
A new approach to quantum key distribution where the key is distributed using quantum teleportation  
4.1 E91 protocol  
The Ekert scheme uses entangled pairs of photons [2]. These can be created by created by Client A, by 
Client B, or by some source separate from both of them, including eavesdropper Eve. The photons are 
distributed so that Client A and Client B each up with one photon from each pair.  
The Scheme relies on two properties of entanglement. First the entangled states are perfectly correlat ed in the 
sense that if Client A and Client B both measure whether their particles have vertical or horizontal polarizations, 
they will always get the same answer with 100% probability. The same is true if they both measure any other 
pair of complementary (orthogonal) polarization However the particular results are completely random, it is 
impossible for Client A to predict if and Client B will get vertical polarization or horizontal polarization.  
Second any attempt at eavesdropping by Eve will destroy thes e correlations in a way that Client A and Client B 
can detect.  
A typical physical set -up is shown in figure 5, using active polarization rotators (PR), polarizing beam -splitters 
(PBS) and avalanche photodiodes (APD)  
 
Figure 5: A Typical System Using Entan gled Photon Pairs [35]  
The measurement in the figure 5 is divided into two groups; the first is when different orientations of the 
analyser were used and the second when the same analyser orientation was employed. Any photon which was 
not registered is dis carded. Alice and Bob then reveal the result of the first group only, and check that they 
correspond to the value expected from Bell‟s inequality. If this is so then Alice and Bob can be sure that the 
results they obtained in the second group are anti -correlated and can be used to produce a secret key string. Eve 
cannot obtain any information from the photons when they are transit as there is simple no information there. 
Information is only present once the authorized  user performs their analyser measuremen ts and key sifting. 
Eve‟s only hope is to inject her own data for Alice and Bob, but as she doesn‟t know their analyser orientations, 
she will always be detected (the Bell‟s inequality value will be too low).  
 
4.2 COW protocol  
Coherent One -Way protocol (C OW protocol) is a new protocol for Quantum cryptography elaborated 
by Nicolas Gisin et al in 2004 [37].  Quantum Key Distribution Protocols: A Review  
www.iosrjournals.org                                                     6 | Page  A new protocol for QKD tailored to work with weak coherent pulses at high bit rates [36]. The advantage of this 
system are that the setup is experimenta lly simple and it is tolerant to reduced interference visibility and to 
photon numbers splitting attacks, thus resulting in a high efficiency in terms of distilled secret bits per qubit  
  
Figure 6: Scheme of the COW protocol [37]  
The figure 6 presents the  COW protocol. The information is encoded in time. Alice sends Coherent pulses that 
are either empty or have a mean ph oton number μ < 1. Each logical bit of information is encoded by sequences 
of two pulses, μ -0 for a logical “0” or 0 -μ for a logical “1”.  
For security reason, Alice can also send decoy sequences μ -μ. To obtain the key, Bob measure the 
time-of-arrival of th e photon on his data -line, detector D B. To ensure the security Bob randomly measures the 
coherence between successive non -empty pulses, bit sequence “1 -0” or decoy sequence, with the interferometer 
and detectors D M1 and D M2. If wavelength of the laser and  the phase in the interferometer are well aligned, we 
have all detection on D M1 and no detection on D M2. A loss of coherence and therefore a reduction of the visibility 
reveal the presence of an eavesdropper, in which case the key is simply discarded, henc e no information will be 
lost.   
 
4.3 DPS protocol  
Differential –phase -shift QKD (DPS -QKD) is a new quantum key distribution scheme that was 
proposed by K.Inoue et al. [38]. Figure 7 shows the setup of the DPS -QKD scheme.  
 
Figure 7: Schematic diagram of D PS protocol [38]  
Alice randomly phase -modulates a pulse train of weak coherent states by {0,π} for each pulse and sends it to 
Bob with an average photon number of less than one per pulse. Bob measure the Phase difference between two 
sequential pulses using a 1 -bit delay. M ach-Zehnder interferometer and photon detectors, and records the photon 
arrival time and which detector clicked. After transmission of the optical pulse train, Bob tells Alice the time 
instances at which a photon was counted. From this time information and  her modulation data. Alice knows 
which detector clicked at Bob‟s site. Under an agreement that a click by detector 1 denotes “0” and click by 
detector 2 denotes “1”, for example Alice and Bob obtain an identical bit string.  
The DPS -QKD scheme has certain advantageous features including a simple configuration, efficient time 
domain use, and robustness against photon number splitting attack [38] [39].  
 
V.      Qther Protocols  
There are many other protocols in existence, both prepare -and-measures and entangle ment based. They 
are as follows:  
5.1. KMB09 protocol  
KMB09 protocol is an alternative quantum key distribution protocol [40]. Where Alice and Bob use 
two mutually unbiased bases with one of them encoding a „0‟ and the other one encoding a „1‟. The securit y of 
the scheme is due to a minimum index transmission error rate (ITER) and quantum bit error rate (QBER) 
introduced by an eavesdropper.  
The ITER increase significantly for higher dimensional photon states. This allows for more Noise  in the 
transmission l ine, thereby increasing the possible distance between Alice and Bob Without the need for 
intermediate nodes

S09 protocol is quantum protocol based on public private key cryptography for secure transmission of 
data over a public channel  [41]. The security of the protocol derives from the fact that Alice and Bob each use 
secret keys in multiple exchange of the qubit. Unlike the BB84 protocol [1] and its many variants. Bob Know 
the key to transmit, the qubits are transmitted in only one di rection and classical information exchanged 
thereafter, the communication in the proposed protocol remains quantum in each stage. In the BB84 protocol, 
each transmitted qubit is in one of four different states in this protocol transmitted qubit can be in a ny arbitrary 
states  
 
5.3 S13 protocol  
S13 protocol is a new quantum protocol [42] that is identical to the BB84 protocol for all the quantum 
manipulation, but differs from it by using Private Reconciliation from a Random Seed and Asymmetric 
Cryptography. Thus allowing the generation of larger secure keys.

VII.      Conclusions  
QKD Protocols are based on principles from quantu m physics and information theory. Quantum key 
distribution is clearly an unconditionally secure means of establishing secret keys. Combined with 
unconditionally secure authentication, and an unconditionally secure cryptosystem.  
The current commercial syste ms are aimed mainly at governments and corporations with high security 
requirements. The major difference of quantum key distribution is the ability to detect any interception of the 
key, whereas with courier the key security cannot be proven or tested. QK D system has the advantage of being 
automatic, with greater reliability and lower operating costs than a secure human courier network
