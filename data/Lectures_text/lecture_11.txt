Lecture 11 – Random Numbers & PRNGs (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Random numbers are required in cryptography for key generation, nonces, salts, IVs, and protocols. Weak randomness leads to compromised systems.


True Random Numbers (TRNG):
Generated from unpredictable physical sources (thermal noise, atmospheric noise).
Properties:
• Non-deterministic
• High entropy
• Not reproducible

Uses:
• Security keys
• Seeding PRNGs

Weakness:
• Hardware dependency
• Slower than PRNGs


Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs):
Algorithmically generate sequences that appear random.

Characteristics:
• Deterministic: Same seed → same output
• Fast & efficient
• Large period before repetition

Quality Requirements:
• Uniform distribution
• Unpredictable without seed
• Large cycle

Uses:
• Key generation
• Padding
• Sampling

Weakness:
• If seed compromised → entire sequence predictable


Cryptographically Secure PRNGs (CSPRNGs):
Meet stronger unpredictability requirements; output cannot be predicted even if some data is leaked.

Construction:
• Based on secure hash, block ciphers, or specific algorithms (e.g., Fortuna)

Applications:
• Key material
• Nonces
• Initialization vectors
