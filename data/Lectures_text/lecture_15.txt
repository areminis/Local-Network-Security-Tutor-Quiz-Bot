Lecture 15 – Cryptographic Hash Algorithms (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Hash functions produce fixed-size output from arbitrary input.


Security Properties:
• Preimage resistance
• Second-preimage resistance
• Collision resistance


Popular Hash Functions:
• SHA-256 → widely used
• SHA-3 → sponge construction
• MD5 → broken
• SHA-1 → collisions discovered

Merkle–Damgård Construction:
Builds hash iteratively from message blocks
- Vulnerable to length-extension (unless used with HMAC)


Sponge Construction (SHA-3):
Absorbing + squeezing phases
More flexible + secure
