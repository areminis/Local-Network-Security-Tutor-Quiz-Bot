Lecture 20 – Authenticated Encryption (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Authenticated Encryption (AE) provides confidentiality + integrity in a single scheme.


Need:
Ciphertext must not only be confidential but also protected from tampering.

Methods:

1) Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM)
- Encrypt message, then MAC ciphertext
- Most secure
- Used in TLS

2) MAC-then-Encrypt (MtE)
- MAC message, then encrypt both
- Weaker; some historical use

3) Encrypt-and-MAC (E&M)
- Encrypt + MAC independently
- Must be used carefully


AEAD:
Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data
Includes additional data (headers) protected for integrity.

Examples:
• AES-GCM
• ChaCha20-Poly1305
