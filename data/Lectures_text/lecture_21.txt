Lecture 21 – Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Elliptic Curve Cryptography provides public-key security using elliptic curve math over finite fields. ECC offers equivalent security to RSA but with much smaller key sizes, making it faster and more resource-efficient.


Elliptic Curves:
Defined over finite field F_p:
E: y² = x³ + ax + b (mod p)

Curve operations:
• Point addition
• Point doubling
• Scalar multiplication (kP)

Scalar multiplication is easy; reversing it (finding k) is hard → basis of ECC security.


Security Basis:
Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP):  
Given P and Q = kP, find k → extremely difficult.

This ensures secure key generation and exchange.

ECC Key Pair:
• Private key: integer k
• Public key: Q = kP (curve point)


Advantages vs RSA:
• Much smaller keys (256-bit ECC ≈ 3072-bit RSA)
• Faster computations
• Lower memory + bandwidth usage
• Excellent for mobile / IoT


ECC Key Exchange:
Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH):
• Both sides compute shared secret S = kA * PB = kB * PA


ECC Signatures:
Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA):
• Produces signatures using ECC’s scalar multiplication structure


Use Cases:
• TLS
• Blockchain (Bitcoin uses ECC/secp256k1)
• Secure messaging
