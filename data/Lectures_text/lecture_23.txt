Lecture 23 – Network Attacks & Defenses (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Networks are vulnerable to interception, modification, and disruption. Understanding attacks + defenses is critical.


Sniffing:
Intercepting network traffic to read plaintext data.
Defense: Encryption (TLS), secure Wi-Fi


Spoofing:
Impersonating another device/address.
Types:
• IP spoofing
• DNS spoofing
• ARP spoofing

Defense:
• Authentication
• DNSSEC
• ARP inspection


Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):
Attacker intercepts + possibly modifies communication.
Defense:
• TLS
• Certificate validation


Replay Attacks:
Attacker reuses captured data/credentials.
Defense:
• Nonces
• Timestamps
• Session tokens


Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS):
Overwhelm server to cause outage.
Defense:
• Rate limiting
• Traffic filtering
• CDN


Session Hijacking:
Stealing session credentials/tokens.
Defense:
• Strong session handling
• Regenerate tokens
• TLS


Secure Network Design:
• Firewalls
• DMZ
• Intrusion Detection Systems
