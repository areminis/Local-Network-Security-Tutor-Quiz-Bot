Lecture 2 – Classical Encryption Techniques (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Classical cryptography involves ancient and pre-modern techniques that transform text to obscure meaning. While insecure by modern standards, these methods form the foundation of modern cryptographic concepts.


Substitution Ciphers:
Replace each symbol in plaintext with another predetermined symbol.

1. Caesar Cipher:
- Shifts letters by fixed amount.
- Example: SHIFT 3 → A→D, B→E
- Easily broken using brute force or frequency analysis.

2. Monoalphabetic Cipher:
- Arbitrary substitution mapping.
- Stronger than Caesar, but still vulnerable to frequency analysis.
- Language patterns reveal ciphertext mapping over time.

3. Polyalphabetic Cipher (Vigenère):
- Uses multiple substitution alphabets depending on key word.
- Example: KEY = "LEMON"
- More resistant to simple frequency analysis.

Weakness:
- Repeating key patterns can leak structure.
- Kasiski test & Friedman test help break it.

Transposition Ciphers:
Preserve the characters but change their order.

Examples:
• Rail Fence  
• Columnar Transposition  

Stronger than pure substitution but still breakable.

Cryptanalysis:
Art of deciphering encrypted messages without the key.

Common Methods:
• Frequency analysis
• Pattern detection
• Known-plaintext attack
• Brute force


Brute-Force Attacks:
Try all possible keys.
- Feasible for classical ciphers due to small keyspace.
- Impractical for modern systems with huge keyspaces.


Limitations:
• Preserve letter frequencies
• Easily broken with modern computing
• Not suitable for secure communications


Historical Importance:
• Foundation for modern symmetric crypto
• Introduced concepts: substitution/permutation
