Lecture 22 – SSL/TLS & Certificates (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a protocol ensuring secure communication over networks (e.g., HTTPS). It provides confidentiality, authentication, and integrity.


TLS Security Goals:
1) Confidentiality → via symmetric encryption
2) Integrity → via MAC / AEAD
3) Authentication → via digital certificates

TLS Handshake (High Level):
1) Client Hello: supported versions, ciphers
2) Server Hello: selected cipher
3) Server Certificate: verify identity
4) Key Exchange: derive shared symmetric keys
5) Finished: secure channel established


Certificates:
Issued by Certificate Authority (CA) to bind a public key to an identity (domain, org).

Components include:
• Subject (owner)
• Public key
• Issuer
• Signature
• Validity


PKI Components:
• CA → signs certificates
• RA → validates requestor
• CRL / OCSP → revocation status


Cipher Suites:
TLS supports combinations of:
• Key exchange: RSA / DH / ECDH
• Encryption: AES, ChaCha20
• MAC: HMAC-SHA256
• AEAD: AES-GCM

Forward Secrecy:
Achieved by ephemeral DH (DHE/ECDHE)
→ exposure of long-term key does not reveal past session keys


TLS Applications:
• HTTPS
• VPN
• Email security (STARTTLS)
