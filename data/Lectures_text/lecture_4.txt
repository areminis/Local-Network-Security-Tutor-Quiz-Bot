Lecture 4 – AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
AES is a symmetric-key block cipher standardized by NIST in 2001 to replace DES.


AES Parameters:
• Block size: 128 bits
• Key sizes: 128 / 192 / 256 bits
• # Rounds: 10 / 12 / 14 respectively


Internal Structure:
AES operates at byte level with a 4×4 state array.

1) SubBytes
- Nonlinear byte substitution using S-box.
- Provides confusion.

2) ShiftRows
- Cyclic left shift of rows.
- Adds diffusion.

3) MixColumns
- Operates on columns using matrix multiplication in GF(2^8)
- Further diffusion.

4) AddRoundKey
- XOR round key with state.

Final Round excludes MixColumns.


Key Expansion:
- Original key expanded into many round keys using Rijndael key schedule.


Security:
• Resistant to differential + linear cryptanalysis
• No known practical attacks
• Large keyspace prevents brute force


Performance:
• Fast in software + hardware
• Used in SSL/TLS, WPA2, VPNs
