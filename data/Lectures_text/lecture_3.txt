Lecture 3 – Block Ciphers & DES (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Block ciphers encrypt data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., 64, 128 bits) using symmetric keys. Data is transformed through multiple rounds to ensure confusion and diffusion.


Feistel Structure:
A design model for block ciphers.

Process:
- Block split into Left (L) + Right (R)
- For each round:
    L(i+1) = R(i)
    R(i+1) = L(i) XOR f(R(i), Ki)

Properties:
• Same structure used for encryption & decryption
• Round function f() can vary


Data Encryption Standard (DES):
- Block size: 64 bits
- Key: 56 bits
- Rounds: 16
- Developed by IBM, adopted by NIST

S-Boxes:
• Perform nonlinear substitution.
• Provide confusion against cryptanalysis.

Key Schedule:
• Generates 16 round subkeys from main key.


Modes of Operation:
1) ECB (Electronic Codebook)
- Each block encrypted independently.
- Patterns preserved → insecure.

2) CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
- XOR plaintext with previous ciphertext block.
- More secure; requires IV.

DES Weaknesses:
• 56-bit key too small → brute-forced in 1998
• Not suitable for new systems

Successor:
• AES replaces DES due to stronger security.
