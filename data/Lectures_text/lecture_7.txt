Lecture 7 – RSA Algorithm (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
RSA is the most widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure key exchange + digital signatures. Security depends on difficulty of factoring.


Key Generation:
1) Select two large primes p & q
2) Compute n = p × q
3) Compute φ(n) = (p–1)(q–1)
4) Select public exponent e such that gcd(e, φ(n))=1
5) Compute private exponent d = e⁻¹ mod φ(n)

Public key: (e, n)
Private key: (d, n)


Encryption:
C = M^e mod n
(decryptable only with d)

Decryption:
M = C^d mod n


Correctness:
e × d ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))
→ Inverse exists → ensures recovery of M


Security Notes:
• Must use large key sizes (2048+ bits)
• Vulnerable if p, q chosen weakly
• Uses padding (OAEP) for security
