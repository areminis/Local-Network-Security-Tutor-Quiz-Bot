Lecture 13 – Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
DH is a method for two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.


Process:
Public parameters: prime p, base g

Steps:
1) Alice chooses random a → A = g^a mod p
2) Bob chooses random b → B = g^b mod p
3) Exchange A, B
4) Shared secret:
   Alice computes S = B^a mod p
   Bob computes S = A^b mod p

Both arrive at same S.


Security:
• Based on discrete logarithm problem (DLP)
• Hard to compute a or b from A or B

Vulnerability:
• Man-In-The-Middle if no authentication
Solution:
• DH + signatures
• DH inside TLS with certificates


Variants:
• Ephemeral DH (DHE) → Forward secrecy
• ECDH → Elliptic curve variant, smaller keys
