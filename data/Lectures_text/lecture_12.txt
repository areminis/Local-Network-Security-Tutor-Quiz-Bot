Lecture 12 – Key Distribution & Key Management (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Key management ensures secure generation, storage, distribution, and revocation of cryptographic keys.


Symmetric Key Distribution:
Problem:
• Shared secret must be exchanged securely

Methods:
1) Physical exchange
2) Through trusted third party
3) Using public-key cryptography


Public-Key Distribution:
• Public keys must be authentic
• Vulnerable to impersonation → certificates required


Key Management Lifecycle:
1) Key Generation – Secure randomness critical
2) Key Distribution – Secure channel or PKI
3) Key Storage – Hardware (HSM) or encrypted software storage
4) Key Use – Access controlled
5) Key Update/Rotation
6) Key Revocation
7) Key Destruction


Key Hierarchy:
• Master key → derives session keys
• Session key → temporary; limits damage


PKI:
Public Key Infrastructure binds identities to public keys using certificates.

Components:
• CA (Certificate Authority)
• RA (Registration Authority)
• Certificate Store
• CRL / OCSP
