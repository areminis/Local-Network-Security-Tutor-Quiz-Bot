Lecture 8 – Digital Signatures (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Digital signatures provide authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. They prove message came from sender and was not altered.


Process:
1) Compute message digest H(M)
2) Sign using private key:
   S = (H(M))^d mod n
3) Verification:
   V = (S^e) mod n
   If V = H(M), signature valid


Why Hash-then-Sign?
• Faster
• Avoids signing large data
• Hardens security


Benefits:
• Integrity
• Authentication
• Non-repudiation


Applications:
• Email signatures (PGP)
• SSL/TLS certificates
• Software authenticity
• Blockchain identity
