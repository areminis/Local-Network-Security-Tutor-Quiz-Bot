Lecture 10 – MAC & HMAC (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Message Authentication Code (MAC) provides integrity + authenticity using a shared secret key.


MAC:
T = MAC(K, M)
Receiver recomputes MAC to verify.

Properties:
• Uses secret key
• Efficient
• Secure against forgery


HMAC:
Combines cryptographic hash + secret key.

Construction:
inner = H((K ⊕ ipad) || M)
HMAC = H((K ⊕ opad) || inner)

Where:
ipad = inner pad constant
opad = outer pad constant


Benefits:
• Resistant to length-extension
• Standardized (RFC 2104)
• Works with SHA-256, SHA-3 etc.

Use Cases:
• TLS
• API authentication
• Secure session validation
