Lecture 14 – Authentication & Access Control (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Authentication verifies identity; Authorization determines privileges.


Authentication Factors:
1) Something you know (password)
2) Something you have (token)
3) Something you are (biometrics)

Stronger authentication uses multi-factor (MFA).


Password Authentication:
Pros: Simple
Cons: Guessable, stealable

Strength:
• Minimum length
• Complexity
• Rate limiting
• Salts + hashing


Authorization Models:
1) DAC – Data owner controls access
2) MAC – Centralized, based on labels
3) RBAC – Role-based; widely used
4) ABAC – Policy + attribute based


Access Control Concepts:
• Least privilege
• Separation of duties
• Need to know
