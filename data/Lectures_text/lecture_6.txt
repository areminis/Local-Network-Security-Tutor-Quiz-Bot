Lecture 6 – Public-Key Cryptography (DETAILED + ELABORATED)

Overview:
Public-Key (Asymmetric) cryptography uses a key pair: public + private. Enables secure communication without prior key sharing.


Why Public-Key?
Symmetric crypto requires secure distribution of secret key. Hard in large networks.

Public-Key solves this:
• Public key can be shared openly
• Private key remains secret


Key Characteristics:
- One key encrypts, the other decrypts
- Computational asymmetry


Applications:
1) Confidentiality:
   Encrypt using receiver’s public key.
   Only private key can decrypt.

2) Authentication / Digital Signature:
   Sign with private key, verify using public key.

3) Key Exchange:
   Negotiate symmetric keys (e.g., Diffie-Hellman)


Algorithms:
• RSA – Based on integer factoring
• DH – Based on discrete logs
• ECC – Uses elliptic curves for smaller key sizes

Limitations:
• Slower than symmetric crypto
• Larger keys needed
• Often used only to exchange symmetric keys
